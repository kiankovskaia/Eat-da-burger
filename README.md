# Eat-da-burger

[Deployed Application]()

## Description

The burger logger app allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM.
